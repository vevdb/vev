# DataScript Test Matrix

This is the working matrix for reaching DataScript compatibility without
turning every Clojure runtime detail into an engine blocker.

Vev's primary long-term consumers are non-Kvist native callers. A feature is
therefore not considered compatibility-complete until it is available through
the EDN/text or prepared-query/transaction surface. Kvist literal macros are
valuable convenience coverage and macro-system exercise, but they are secondary
frontends over the same typed query/tx/pull representations.

Status:

- `passing`: comparable Vev tests exist and pass
- `partial`: a useful subset is ported, more semantic cases remain
- `planned`: not ported yet, should become Vev tests
- `interop`: requires EDN/text APIs, parser frontend, or C ABI-facing shape
- `host`: Clojure/JVM/runtime behavior, not core engine semantics

Current local baseline: `kvist test src/vev_tests/vev_test.kvist` runs 351
tests successfully. The most important remaining gaps are no longer basic
Datalog syntax or transaction shape coverage; they are exact parser validation,
remaining native callback design, and semi-naive rule/query optimization.

## Semantic Core

These are the main in-memory parity target before durable storage.

## Parser And Portable API

These are the primary compatibility gate for broad consumption. The first query
and transaction text APIs now exist, and query text inputs are consumed in
DataScript `:in` source order, but full parser parity still trails some native
Kvist literal conveniences. New DataScript compatibility work should prefer
EDN/text coverage first and add Kvist macro coverage as a convenience layer.

| `parser.cljc` | 3 | partial | direct parser APIs now cover DataScript binding, `:in`, and `:with` shapes including scalar vars, `_`, collection, tuple, nested collection/tuple bindings, source vars, and `%`; flat EDN node reader also feeds query/pull/tx/rules text subsets; prepared binding/`:in`/`:with` values have portable EDN-ish `Value.Map` rendering. Exact Clojure parser record rendering and diagnostics remain Vev-shaped |

| `pull_parser.cljc` | 1 | passing | query text pull finds, pull pattern variables, direct pull text APIs, and reusable prepared pull pattern values cover attrs, wildcard including string `"*"`, DataScript namespaced reverse attrs, nested maps with vector or list pattern values, recursive map values including string ellipsis, flat/nested `:default`/`:as`/`:limit`/`:xform` option forms including string/vector option heads, repeated attr specs, option-wrapped map keys, checked rejection of malformed option/map specs, and schema-aware validation for reverse refs, nested refs/recursion, and explicit limits through query pull literals and pattern inputs; exact parser object rendering/diagnostic text is Vev-shaped |
| transaction EDN text | n/a | partial | `transact-text`, immutable `with-text`/`db-with-text`, reusable prepared tx-data, and immutable `with-prepared`/`db-with-prepared` cover `:db/add`, `:db/retract`, `:db/retractEntity`, `:db.fn/retractAttribute`, `:db.fn/cas`, `:db.fn/call`/shorthand transaction functions with typed value args, single operation vectors, map tx-data, set-valued collections, lookup refs, idents, float values, string/current-tx/negative numeric tempids, generated map ids, nested maps, reverse ref tx-map attrs including nested maps, ordinary and tuple upsert/lookup-ref transactions, and bad-shape/no-mutation validation through the normal transaction engine |

## Host Or Later Runtime APIs

These are useful, but not the next engine-parity gate.

| Namespace | Upstream tests | Status | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `conn.cljc` | 2 | passing | create/conn-from-db/conn-from-datoms and reset reports with tx-data, before/after snapshots, metadata, and listener delivery are covered; Clojure schema-map storage shape is host |

| `serialize.cljc` | 5 | passing | `init-db` from datoms plus typed serializable and EDN-ish datom snapshot text roundtrips covered, including schema, retractions, refs, symbol/map/vector values, special floats, and next-tx recovery; DataScript's JVM/CLJS codec matrix is host/format work |
| `storage.clj` | 5 | planned | durable/storage work later |
| `datafy.cljc` | 1 | host | Clojure-specific shape |
| `db.cljc` | 4 | passing | semantic DB diff is covered; record-updatable, hash-cache, and UUID helpers are Clojure/DataScript runtime details |
| `issues.cljc` | 5 | passing | issue-262 vector result isolation, issue-369 mixed-type DB diff, and issue-381 schema inspection are covered; issue-330/331 are Clojure pprint/meta host behavior |
| `query_v3.cljc` | 2 | passing | active validation cases plus the disabled relation-query example are covered through Vev relation DB APIs, including arity, non-collection sources, explicit `$`, prepared queries, and scalar/tuple/map primary sources |
| `lru.cljc` | 2 | host | DataScript implementation detail |
| `core.cljc` | 1 | host | test harness/runtime behavior |
| `cljs.cljc` | 0 | host | ClojureScript environment behavior |

## Batch Order

1. Tighten parser validation against `parser_*.cljc`, especially malformed
   `:find`, `:in`, `:where`, rule, pull, and return-map shapes. This matters
   because EDN text/prepared APIs are the compatibility route for non-Kvist
   consumers.
2. Extend the native callback surface beyond query predicate/value/aggregate
   and pull `:xform` callbacks: transaction functions, listeners, and final
   C/Odin/non-Kvist registration shape.
3. Replace the current rule/fixpoint and aggregate hot paths with measured
   implementations. The current engine is semantically useful, but DataScript
   parity also needs predictable performance on recursive rules and large
   relations.
4. Keep Kvist literal macros aligned with the typed AST as ergonomic sugar, not
   as the definition of compatibility.
